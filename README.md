Learning Rust &amp; Bevy by building Wordle

### Context
This repo is intended as a project to help me get back up and running with Rust and also to try out running a game engine in Rust.

I chose Wordle because i know the logic so I can focus on the coding.

### Learning Outcomes
Turns out choosing a static word based game was a terrible idea for bevy game engine. Game engines are great when you have moving entities that spawn and die. But Wordle is a static set of 30 tiles. Must better fit for a classic web app.

I did enjoy learning about Bevy and their ECS data store. The APIs and documentation is well put together. If I would continue with Bevy, I think it would be better to try to emulate a more traditional game, perhaps breakout, or tetris, and make some game assets in Blender.
